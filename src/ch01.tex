\chapter{The Real and Complex Number Systems}

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all numbers in this chapter's
exercises are understood to be real.

\Exercise1 If $r$ is rational ($r\neq0$) and $x$ is irrational, prove
that $r + x$ and $rx$ are irrational.
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $r$ is rational, so that $r = a/b$ for $a,b\in Z$, and let
  $x$ be irrational. Now assume for contradiction that $r + x$ is
  rational. Then, for some integers $c$ and $d$, we can write
  \begin{equation*}
    x = (r + x) - r = \frac{c}{d} - \frac{a}{b} = \frac{bc - ad}{bd},
  \end{equation*}
  so that $x$ is rational: a contradiction. Therefore $r + x$ must be
  irrational.

  Similarly, if we assume that $rx = c/d$ for $c,d\in Z$, then, since
  $r\neq0$,
  \begin{equation*}
    x = \frac1r(rx) = \frac{b}{a}\cdot\frac{c}{d} = \frac{bc}{ad},
  \end{equation*}
  again a contradiction. Hence $rx$ must be irrational.
\end{proof}

\Exercise2 Prove that there is no rational number whose square is
$12$.
\begin{proof}
  Assume the contrary, and let $p$ and $q$ be integers such that
  $p^2 = 12q^2$. We may further suppose that $p$ and $q$ have no
  common factors other than $1$. Then $2$ divides $p^2$ so that $2$
  divides $p$ as well. Thus we can write $p = 2k$ for $k\in Z$. Then
  $4k^2 = 12q^2$, which implies that $k^2 = 3q^2$.

  Now $3$ divides $k^2$, so $3$ divides $k$ as well (if $3$ does not
  divide $k$, then $3$ could not divide $k^2$ since $3$ is prime),
  allowing us to write $k = 3\ell$ for $\ell\in Z$. Hence
  $3q^2 = 9\ell^2$ which implies that $q^2 = 3\ell^2$. Then $3$
  divides $q^2$ and thus $q$ as well. Since $3$ divides $k$, it must
  divide $p$, and we see that $3$ is a common factor of $p$ and $q$,
  which contradicts our choice of $p$ and $q$. Therefore there is no
  rational number $p/q$ whose square is $12$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise3 Prove Proposition~1.15:
\begin{prop}
  Let $F$ be a field and let $x,y,z\in F$. Then the following
  properties hold.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x\neq0$ and $xy = xz$ then $y = z$.
  \item If $x\neq0$ and $xy = x$ then $y = 1$.
  \item If $x\neq0$ and $xy = 1$, then $y = 1/x$.
  \item If $x\neq0$ then $1/(1/x) = x$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $x,y,z$ be such that $xy = xz$, with $x\neq0$. Since $x$
    is nonzero, it has a multiplicative inverse $1/x$. So
    \begin{equation*}
      y = 1y = \left(\frac1x\cdot x\right)y
      = \frac1x(xy) = \frac1x(xz)
      = \left(\frac1x\cdot x\right)z = 1z = z.
    \end{equation*}

  \item Suppose $xy = x$, $x\neq0$. As before, $1/x$ exists, so we have
    \begin{equation*}
      y = 1y = \left(\frac1x\cdot x\right)y
      = \frac1x(xy) = \frac1x\cdot x = 1.
    \end{equation*}

  \item \label{y-eq-recip-x-proof} If $xy = 1$, $x\neq0$, then
    \begin{equation*}
      y = 1y = \left(\frac1x\cdot x\right)y
      = \frac1x(xy) = \frac1x\cdot1
      = \frac1x.
    \end{equation*}

  \item Let $x\neq0$. Since $(1/x)x = 1$, it follows from part
    \ref{y-eq-recip-x-proof} above that $x = 1/(1/x)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\Exercise4 Let $E$ be a nonempty subset of an ordered set; suppose
$\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and $\beta$ is an upper bound of
$E$. Prove that $\alpha\leq\beta$.
\begin{proof}
  Since $E$ is nonempty, we may choose $n\in E$. $\alpha$ is a lower
  bound of $E$, so $\alpha\leq n$. On the other hand, $\beta$ is an
  upper bound, so $n\leq\beta$. By the transitive property for ordered
  sets (see Definition~1.5 in the text), $\alpha\leq n$ and
  $n\leq\beta$ together imply that $\alpha\leq\beta$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise5 Let $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded
below. Let $-A$ be the set of all numbers $-x$, where $x\in A$. Prove
that
\begin{equation*}
  \inf A = -\sup(-A).
\end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Let $a = \inf A$ and choose any $b\in-A$ (we know $-A$ is nonempty
  since $A$ is nonempty). Then $-b\in A$ so that $a\leq-b$, which
  implies $b\leq-a$. And $b$ was arbitrary, so $-a = -\inf A$ is an upper bound
  for $-A$.

  $-A$ is bounded above, so it has a least upper bound $c =
  \sup(-A)$. We need to show that $c = -a$. Assume the contrary, and
  suppose $c < -a$. Then since $c$ is an upper bound for $-A$, we have
  $c\geq b$ for all $b$ in $-A$. Then $-c\leq-b$, with $-b\in A$, so
  that $-c$ is a lower bound for $A$. But $c < -a$, so $-c > a$. Hence
  $-c$ is a lower bound for $A$, and it is larger than $a = \inf A$, a
  contradiction. This shows that $c = -a$, so that
  $\sup(-A) = -\inf A$ as required.
\end{proof}

% \Exercise6 Fix $b>1$.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item If $m, n, p, q$ are integers, $n>0, q>0$, and $r = m/n = p/q$,
%   prove that
%   \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:ratb}
%     (b^m)^{1/n} = (b^p)^{1/q}.
%   \end{equation}
%   Hence it makes sense to define $b^r = (b^m)^{1/n}$.
%   \begin{proof}
%     If $r = 0$ then the result is obvious, so suppose $r\neq0$.

%     Let $c = (b^m)^{1/n}$ and let $d = (b^p)^{1/q}$. We want to show
%     that $c = d$.

%     By definition, $b^m = c^n$ and $b^p = d^q$. Then
%     $b^{mp} = (b^m)^p = c^{np}$. However, $np = mq$, so this implies
%     that $b^{mp} = c^{mq}$. On the other hand,
%     $b^{mp} = (b^p)^m = d^{mq}$. Hence $c^{mq} = d^{mq}$.

%     Now either $m > 0$ or $m < 0$. In the former case, $mq > 0$ so
%     that $c = d$ by the uniqueness condition in Theorem~1.21. On the
%     other hand, if $m < 0$, then $c^{-mq} = d^{-mq}$ and $c = d$ by
%     the same argument. Therefore equation \eqref{eq:ratb} holds.
%   \end{proof}

% \item Prove that $b^{r+s} = b^rb^s$ if $r$ and $s$ are rational.
%   \begin{proof}
%     Let $r = m/n$ and $s = p/q$, where $m,n,p,q$ are integers with
%     $n,q>0$. Then
%     \begin{equation*}
%       (b^{r+s})^{nq} = b^{mq+np} = b^{mq}b^{np}.
%     \end{equation*}
%     Then
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^{r+s} = (b^{mq}b^{np})^{1/(nq)},
%     \end{equation*}
%     and by the corollary to Theorem~1.21, we have
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^{r+s} = (b^{mq})^{1/(nq)}(b^{np})^{1/(nq)} = b^rb^s.\qedhere
%     \end{equation*}
%   \end{proof}

% \item If $x$ is real, define $B(x)$ to be the set of all numbers
%   $b^t$, where $t$ is rational and $t\leq x$. Prove that
%   \begin{equation*}
%     b^r = \sup B(r)
%   \end{equation*}
%   when $r$ is rational. Hence it makes sense to define
%   \begin{equation*}
%     b^x = \sup B(x)
%   \end{equation*}
%   for every real $x$.
%   \begin{proof}
%     Let $r$ and $t$ be rational numbers, with $t\leq r$. Then there
%     are integers $m,n,p,q$ with $n,q>0$ such that $r = m/n$ and
%     $t = p/q$.

%     Let $\beta = b^{1/(nq)}$. We will show that $\beta$ must be
%     greater than $1$. For, if not, suppose $\beta\leq1$. Then
%     $\beta^2\leq\beta$, and similarly $\beta^3\leq\beta^2\leq\beta$,
%     and a simple induction argument will show that
%     $b = \beta^{nq}\leq\beta\leq1$. But $b > 1$, so this is a
%     contradiction. Therefore $\beta > 1$.

%     Now since $t\leq r$, we have $np\leq mq$, which implies that
%     $\beta^{np}\leq\beta^{mq}$. So we have
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^t = (\beta^{nq})^t = \beta^{np}
%       \leq \beta^{mq} = (\beta^{nq})^r = b^r.
%     \end{equation*}
%     Since $t$ was arbitrary, $b^r$ is an upper bound for $B(r)$.

%     Finally, $b^r$ must be the least upper bound for $B(r)$, since
%     $b^r$ is itself a member of $B(r)$.
%   \end{proof}

% \item Prove that $b^{x+y} = b^xb^y$ for all real $x$ and $y$.
% \end{enumerate}

% \Exercise7 Fix $b>1, y>0$, and prove that there is a unique real $x$
% such that $b^x = y$, by completing the following outline. (This $x$ is
% called the {\em logarithm of $y$ to the base $b$}.)
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item For any positive integer $n$, $b^n-1\geq n(b - 1)$.
%   \label{b-inequality}
%   \begin{proof}
%     We use induction on $n$. For $n = 1$, the result is obvious. So
%     suppose it is true for $n = k$. Then, using this induction
%     hypothesis, we may write
%     \begin{align*}
%       b^{k+1} - 1
%       &= b^{k+1} - b^k + b^k - 1 \\
%       &\geq b^{k+1} - b^k + k(b - 1) \\
%       &= (b - 1)(b^k + k).
%     \end{align*}
%     And finally, since $b > 1$, it follows that $b^k>1$ which gives
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^{k+1} - 1 \geq (k + 1)(b - 1),
%     \end{equation*}
%     which completes the inductive step. Hence the result is true for
%     all integers $n\geq1$.
%   \end{proof}
% \item Hence $b - 1\geq n(b^{1/n} - 1)$.
%   \label{b-nth-root-inequality}
%   \begin{proof}
%     Take the result from part \ref{b-inequality} and replace $b$ with
%     $b^{1/n}$, noting that $b^{1/n}$ must be greater than $1$.
%   \end{proof}
% \item If $t > 1$ and $n > (b - 1)/(t - 1)$, then $b^{1/n} < t$.
%   \label{b-nth-root-less-than-t}
%   \begin{proof}
%     Suppose $t$ and $n$ satisfy the stated conditions. Part
%     \ref{b-nth-root-inequality} implies
%     \begin{align*}
%       n > \frac{b-1}{t-1} \geq \frac{n(b^{1/n} - 1)}{t-1}
%     \end{align*}
%     or
%     \begin{equation*}
%       1 > \frac{b^{1/n} - 1}{t-1}.
%     \end{equation*}
%     Since $t>1$, we can rearrange to get
%     \begin{equation*}
%       t > b^{1/n}
%     \end{equation*}
%     as desired.
%   \end{proof}
% \item If $w$ is such that $b^w<y$, then $b^{w+(1/n)}<y$ for
%   sufficiently large $n$.
%   \begin{proof}
%     \label{b-to-the-w-less-than-y}
%     Let $t = yb^{-w}$. Since $y > b^w$, we have $t > 1$. By the
%     archimedean property of $R$ (see Theorem~1.20a), there is a
%     positive integer $n$ such that
%     \begin{equation*}
%       n(t - 1) > b - 1.
%     \end{equation*}
%     So, by part \ref{b-nth-root-less-than-t}, we have
%     $b^{1/n} < t = yb^{-w}$ which gives
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^{w+(1/n)} < y
%     \end{equation*}
%     as required.
%   \end{proof}
% \item If $b^w > y$, then $b^{w-(1/n)}>y$ for sufficiently large $n$.
%   \begin{proof}
%     \label{b-to-the-w-greater-than-y}
%     Let $t = b^w/y$. Then $t > 1$. Again, we can find an $n$ such that
%     $n(t-1) > b-1$ so part \ref{b-nth-root-less-than-t} gives
%     $b^{1/n} < b^w/y$ or, rearranging,
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^{w-(1/n)} > y. \qedhere
%     \end{equation*}
%   \end{proof}
% \item Let $A$ be the set of all $w$ such that $b^w < y$, and show that
%   $x = \sup A$ satisfies $b^x = y$.
%   \begin{proof}
%     There are three possibilities: $b^x < y$, $b^x > y$, or $b^x = y$.

%     Suppose that $b^x < y$. Then by part \ref{b-to-the-w-less-than-y}
%     there is a positive integer $n$ such that $b^{x+1/n} <
%     y$. Therefore $x + 1/n\in A$ which contradicts the fact that $x$
%     is an upper bound for $A$.

%     On the other hand, if $b^x > y$, then part
%     \ref{b-to-the-w-greater-than-y} allows us to find a positive
%     integer $n$ such that $b^{x-1/n} > y$. Then $x-1/n\not\in A$ so
%     $x-1/n$ is an upper bound for $A$. But this contradicts the fact
%     that $x$ is the least upper bound for $A$.

%     We see that the only remaining possibility is that $b^x = y$.
%   \end{proof}
% \item Prove that this $x$ is unique.
%   \begin{proof}
%     Suppose $x$ is such that $b^x = y$ and let $z > x$. Then
%     \begin{equation*}
%       b^z = b^{x+(z-x)} = b^xb^{z-x} > b^x = y,
%     \end{equation*}
%     so $b^z\neq y$. Now suppose instead that $z < x$. If $b^z = y$
%     then the previous argument shows that $b^x\neq y$, which is a
%     contradiction. Therefore $b^z\neq y$ in this case as well. So $x$
%     is unique.
%   \end{proof}
% \end{enumerate}

\Exercise8 Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field
that turns it into an ordered field.
\begin{proof}
  Assume the contrary, so that the set of complex numbers is an
  ordered field with order $<$. Then by Proposition~1.18d,
  $-1 = i^2 > 0$. But then $0 = -1 + 1 > 0 + 1 = 1$. Hence $0 >
  1$. But again by Proposition~1.18d, $1 = 1^2 > 0$. This is a
  contradiction, so the complex numbers cannot be an ordered field.
\end{proof}

\Exercise9 Suppose $z = a + bi$, $w = c + di$. Define $z < w$ if
$a < c$, and also if $a = c$ but $b < d$. Prove that this turns the
set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. Does this ordered set
have the least-upper-bound property?
\begin{note}
  For clarity, we will use the symbol $\lessdot$ to represent the
  complex ordering defined above. For the rest of this exercise, the
  ordinary $<$ symbol will only denote the usual ordering on $R$.
\end{note}
\begin{proof}
  Let $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di$ be arbitrary complex numbers, with
  $a,b,c,d\in R$. Since $R$ is an ordered field, exactly one of the
  statements $a < c$, $a > c$, or $a = c$ must be true. We consider
  each case in turn: First, if $a < c$ then $z \lessdot w$ but
  $w \nlessdot z$ and certainly $z\neq w$. Next, if $a > c$, then
  $w \lessdot z$ while $z \nlessdot w$ and $z\neq w$.

  In the case where $a = c$, then either $b < d$, $b > d$, or $b =
  d$. If $b < d$ then $z \lessdot w$ while $w \nlessdot z$ and
  $z\neq w$. Similarly, if $b > d$, then $w \lessdot z$ while
  $z \nlessdot w$ and $z\neq w$. And if $b = d$, then $z = w$ and
  neither of the statements $z \lessdot w$ and $w \lessdot z$ are
  true.

  In every case, exactly one of $z \lessdot w$, $w \lessdot z$, or
  $z = w$ is true.

  Lastly, suppose that $x = a_1 + b_1i$, $y = a_2 + b_2i$, and
  $z = a_3 + b_3i$ are complex numbers with $a_k,b_k\in R$ and such
  that $x \lessdot y$ and $y \lessdot z$. There are four cases: If
  $a_1 < a_2 < a_3$, or if $a_1 < a_2 = a_3$, or if $a_1 = a_2 < a_3$
  then $a_1 < a_3$ and $x \lessdot z$. The last case is where
  $a_1 = a_2 = a_3$. In that case we must have $b_1 < b_2 < b_3$ so
  that $b_1 < b_3$ and $x \lessdot z$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  This ordered set does not have the least-upper-bound property.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Define $A$ to be the set of all complex numbers $a + bi$ with
  $a,b\in R$ such that $a < 0$. Then clearly $A$ is bounded above by
  $0$. Now suppose that $z = x + yi$ is any upper bound for $A$.

  First note that $x\geq0$. For, if not, we could choose a real number
  $x'$ such that $x < x' < 0$. But then $x'\in A$ and $z\lessdot x'$,
  which would give a contradiction.

  Now let $y'$ be any real number less than $y$. Since $x\geq0$, the
  complex number $x + y'i$ is an upper bound for $A$. But
  $x + y'i \lessdot z$, so $z$ cannot be the least upper bound for
  $A$. Since $z$ was arbitrary, this shows that the nonempty set $A$,
  which is bounded above, has no least upper bound.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{10} Suppose $z = a + bi$, $w = u + iv$, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:a-b-complex}
  a = \left(\frac{\abs{w} + u}2\right)^{1/2}, \quad
  b = \left(\frac{\abs{w} - u}2\right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
Prove that $z^2 = w$ if $v\geq0$ and that $(\bar z)^2 = w$ if
$v\leq0$. Conclude that every complex number (with one exception!) has
two complex square roots.
\begin{proof}
  Direct computation gives
  \begin{align*}
    z^2 &= a^2 - b^2 + 2abi \\
        &= \frac{\abs{w} + u}2 - \frac{\abs{w} - u}2
          + 2\left(\frac{\abs{w} + u}2\right)^{1/2}
          \left(\frac{\abs{w} - u}2\right)^{1/2}i \\
        &= u + \left(\abs{w}^2 - u^2\right)^{1/2}i \\
        &= u + \left(v^2\right)^{1/2}i \\
        &= u + \abs{v}i.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore $z^2 = w$ if $v\geq0$ and $z^2 = \overline{w}$ if
  $v\leq0$. In the latter case, we have
  $(\bar z)^2 = \overline{(z^2)} = w$ (by Theorem~1.31b).

  Now, let $w = u + vi$ be any complex number, and define $a$ and $b$
  as in \eqref{eq:a-b-complex}. If $v > 0$, then $z = a + bi$ and
  $-z = -a - bi$ are distinct complex numbers such that $z^2 = w$ and
  $(-z)^2 = w$. On the other hand, if $v < 0$, then $\bar{z} = a - bi$
  and $-\bar{z} = -a + bi$ are distinct values with $(\bar{z})^2 = w$
  and $(-\bar{z})^2 = w$. And lastly, if $v = 0$ and $u\neq0$ then
  $y = \abs{u}^{1/2}$ and $-y = -\abs{u}^{1/2}$ are distinct with
  $y^2 = w$ and $(-y)^2 = w$. Therefore the only complex number that
  does not have two distinct complex square roots is $0$ itself.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{11} If $z$ is a complex number, prove that there exists an
$r\geq0$ and a complex number $w$ with $\abs{w} = 1$ such that
$z = rw$. Are $w$ and $r$ always uniquely determined by $z$?
\begin{proof}
  If $z = 0$, we may take $r = 0$ and $w = 1$.

  Otherwise, $\abs{z} > 0$ and we may simply let
  \begin{equation*}
    r = \abs{z} \quad\text{and}\quad w = \frac{z}{\abs{z}}.
  \end{equation*}
  Then $z = rw$, and $r\geq0$ by Theorem~1.33a. Moreover,
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{w} = (w\overline{w})^{1/2}
    = \left(\frac{z\bar{z}}{\abs{z}^2}\right)^{1/2}
    = 1. \qedhere
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
  $w$ and $r$ are uniquely determined by $z$ if and only if $z\neq0$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  First, fix a nonzero complex number $z$. Suppose
  $z = r_1w_1 = r_2w_2$, where $r_1,r_2\geq0$ and
  $\abs{w_1} = \abs{w_2} = 1$. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    r_1 = \abs{r_1}\abs{w_1} = \abs{z} = \abs{r_2}\abs{w_2} = r_2
  \end{equation*}
  and, since $z$ is nonzero, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive and we have
  \begin{equation*}
    w_1 = \frac{r_2w_2}{r_1} = w_2.
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore $w$ and $r$ are uniquely determined.

  To prove the other direction, suppose $z = 0$. Then we may let
  $r = 0$, $w_1 = 1$, and $w_2 = -1$ so that $z = rw_1 = rw_2$ but
  $w_1\neq w_2$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{12} If $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ are complex, prove that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gen-complex-triangle-ineq}
  \abs{z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_n}
  \leq \abs{z_1} + \abs{z_2} + \cdots + \abs{z_n}.
\end{equation}
\begin{proof}
  We use induction on $n$. The case where $n = 1$ is trivial. Now
  suppose \eqref{eq:gen-complex-triangle-ineq} holds for $n = k$ where
  $k$ is any positive integer. Then by Theorem~1.33e and the induction
  hypothesis we have
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_k + z_{k+1}}
    &= \abs{z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_{k-1} + (z_k + z_{k+1})} \\
    &\leq \abs{z_1} + \abs{z_2} + \cdots + \abs{z_{k-1}}
      + \abs{z_k + z_{k+1}} \\
    &\leq \abs{z_1} + \abs{z_2} + \cdots + \abs{z_{k-1}}
      + \abs{z_k} + \abs{z_{k+1}}.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore \eqref{eq:gen-complex-triangle-ineq} holds for all
  positive integers $n$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{13} If $x, y$ are complex, prove that
\begin{equation*}
  \big\lvert\abs{x} - \abs{y}\big\rvert \leq \abs{x - y}.
\end{equation*}
\label{exercise-abs-abs-x-minus-abs-y}
\begin{proof}
  The triangle inequality from Theorem~1.33e gives
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{x} = \abs{x - y + y} \leq \abs{x - y} + \abs{y}
  \end{equation*}
  so $\abs{x} - \abs{y} \leq \abs{x - y}$. Similarly,
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{y} = \abs{y - x + x} \leq \abs{x - y} + \abs{x}
  \end{equation*}
  which gives $\abs{y} - \abs{x} \leq \abs{x - y}$.

  Now there are two cases:
  \begin{align*}
    \big\lvert\abs{x} - \abs{y}\big\rvert = \abs{x} - \abs{y}
    \quad\text{if $\abs{x} - \abs{y} \geq 0$,}
  \end{align*}
  or
  \begin{align*}
    \big\lvert\abs{x} - \abs{y}\big\rvert = \abs{y} - \abs{x}
    \quad\text{if $\abs{x} - \abs{y} \leq 0$.}
  \end{align*}
  Either way, we get
  $\big\lvert\abs{x} - \abs{y}\big\rvert \leq \abs{x - y}$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{14} If $z$ is a complex number such that $\abs{z} = 1$, that
is, such that $z\bar{z} = 1$, compute
\begin{equation*}
  \abs{1 + z}^2 + \abs{1 - z}^2.
\end{equation*}
\begin{solution}
  Using Theorem~1.31, we get
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{1 + z}^2 &= (1 + z)\overline{(1 + z)} \\
                  &= (1 + z)(1 + \bar{z}) \\
                  &= 1 + z + \bar{z} + z\bar{z} \\
                  &= 2 + 2\Realpart z,
  \end{align*}
  and, similarly,
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{1 - z}^2 &= (1 - z)(1 - \bar{z}) \\
                  &= 1 - z - \bar{z} + z\bar{z} \\
                  &= 2 - 2\Realpart z.
  \end{align*}
  Hence
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{1 + z}^2 + \abs{1 - z}^2 = 4. \qedhere
  \end{equation*}
\end{solution}

\Exercise{15} Under what conditions does equality hold in the Schwartz
inequality?
\begin{solution}
  Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be defined as in the proof of
  Theorem~1.35. From that proof, we have equality when $Ba_j = Cb_j$
  for each $j$ from $1$ to $n$. This will be the case when
  $a_j = kb_j$ for some constant $k = C/B$.
\end{solution}

% \Exercise{16} Suppose $k\geq3$, $\vec{x}, \vec{y}\in R^k$,
% $\abs{\vec{x} - \vec{y}} = d > 0$, and $r > 0$. Prove:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \label{two-r-gt-d} If $2r > d$, there are infinitely many
%   $\vec{z}\in R^k$ such that
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \abs{\vec{z} - \vec{x}} = \abs{\vec{z} - \vec{y}} = r.
%   \end{equation*}
% \item \label{two-r-eq-d} If $2r = d$, there is exactly one such
%   $\vec{z}$.
% \item \label{two-r-lt-d} If $2r < d$, there is no such $\vec{z}$.
% \end{enumerate}
% How must these statements be modified if $k$ is $2$ or $1$?
% \begin{solution}
%   Using Theorem~1.37e we have, for any $\vec{z}\in R^k$,
%   \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:vec-dist-inequality}
%     d = \abs{\vec{x} - \vec{y}}
%     = \abs{(\vec{x} - \vec{z}) + (\vec{z} - \vec{y})}
%     \leq \abs{\vec{z} - \vec{x}} + \abs{\vec{z} - \vec{y}}.
%   \end{equation}
%   So, if $\abs{\vec{z} - \vec{x}} = \abs{\vec{z} - \vec{y}} = r$ then
%   we must have $d \leq 2r$. Thus if $2r < d$, then no $\vec{z}\in R^k$
%   will satisfy \eqref{eq:vec-dist-inequality}, which shows
%   \ref{two-r-lt-d}.

%   If $2r = d$, then we must have equality in
%   \eqref{eq:vec-dist-inequality}. This will happen when
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \vec{z} = \frac12(\vec{x} + \vec{y}).
%   \end{equation*}
%   Then
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \vec{x} - \vec{z}
%     = \frac12(\vec{x} - \vec{y})
%     = \vec{z} - \vec{y},
%   \end{equation*}
%   so
%   \begin{align*}
%     d &= \abs{\vec{x} - \vec{y}} \\
%     &= \abs{(\vec{x} - \vec{z}) + (\vec{z} - \vec{y})} \\
%     &= \abs{2(\vec{x} - \vec{z})} \\
%     &= 2\abs{\vec{x} - \vec{z}} = 2r.
%   \end{align*}
%   So \ref{two-r-eq-d} holds.

%   Finally, suppose $2r > d$. Looking at the proof of Theorem~1.37e, we
%   see that in order to have strict inequality in
%   \eqref{eq:vec-dist-inequality}, we must have
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \abs{(\vec{x}-\vec{z})\cdot(\vec{z}-\vec{y})}
%     < \abs{\vec{x}-\vec{z}}\abs{\vec{z}-\vec{y}}.
%   \end{equation*}
%   If $\vec{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_k)$, $\vec{y} = (y_1,\dots,y_k)$, and
%   $\vec{z} = (z_1,\dots,z_k)$, then the above inequality becomes
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \abs{(\vec{x}-\vec{z})\cdot(\vec{z}-\vec{y})}
%     = \Abs{\sum_{j=1}^k(x_j - z_j)(z_j - y_j)} < 2r.
%   \end{equation*}
% \end{solution}

\Exercise{17} Prove that
\begin{equation*}
  \abs{\vec{x} + \vec{y}}^2 + \abs{\vec{x} - \vec{y}}^2
  = 2\abs{\vec{x}}^2 + 2\abs{\vec{y}}^2
\end{equation*}
if $\vec{x}\in R^k$ and $\vec{y}\in R^k$. Interpret this
geometrically, as a statement about parallelograms.
\begin{proof}
  For any $\vec{x},\vec{y}\in R^k$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{\vec{x} + \vec{y}}^2 + \abs{\vec{x} - \vec{y}}^2
    &= (\vec{x} + \vec{y})\cdot(\vec{x} + \vec{y})
      + (\vec{x} - \vec{y})\cdot(\vec{x} - \vec{y}) \\
    &= \left(\abs{\vec{x}}^2 + 2\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} + \abs{\vec{y}}^2\right)
      + \left(\abs{\vec{x}}^2 - 2\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} + \abs{\vec{y}}^2\right) \\
    &= 2\abs{\vec{x}}^2 + 2\abs{\vec{y}}^2. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Geometrically, this result says that the sum of the squares on the
diagonals of a parallelogram is equal to the sum of the squares on its
sides. When $\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} = 0$ the parallelogram is a rectangle
and the statement reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem.

\Exercise{18} If $k\geq2$ and $\vec{x}\in R^k$, prove that there
exists $\vec{y}\in R^k$ such that $\vec{y}\neq\vec{0}$ but
$\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} = 0$. Is this also true if $k = 1$?
\begin{proof}
  Let $\vec{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_k)$. If $x_1$ or $x_2$ are nonzero,
  then we may let $\vec{y} = (x_2, -x_1, 0, 0, \dots, 0)$ (provided
  $k > 1$). Then $\vec{y}\neq\vec{0}$ but $\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} =
  0$. On the other hand, if either or both of $x_1,x_2$ are $0$, then
  let $\vec{y}$ be the vector whose coordinates are all $0$ except
  with a $1$ in the same position as one of the zero coordinates from
  $\vec{x}$. Again, $\vec{y}$ is nonzero while
  $\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y} = 0$.

  Finally, we note that the result is {\em not} true for $k = 1$. For
  example, if $x = 1$, then there is no nonzero $y$ with $xy = 0$.
\end{proof}

\Exercise{19} Suppose $\vec{a}\in R^k$, $\vec{b}\in R^k$. Find
$\vec{c}\in R^k$ and $r > 0$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dist-x-a}
  \abs{\vec{x}-\vec{a}} = 2\abs{\vec{x}-\vec{b}}
\end{equation}
if and only if $\abs{\vec{x} - \vec{c}} = r$.
\begin{solution}
  Set
  \begin{equation*}
    \vec{c} = \frac13\left(4\vec{b} - \vec{a}\right)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    r = \frac23\abs{\vec{b} - \vec{a}}.
  \end{equation*}
  Since norms are nonnegative, $\abs{\vec{x}-\vec{c}}=r$ if and only
  if
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{\vec{x}-\vec{c}}^2 = r^2,
  \end{equation*}
  or
  \begin{equation*}
    \Abs{\vec{x} - \frac13\left(4\vec{b} - \vec{a}\right)}^2
    = \frac49\abs{\vec{b}-\vec{a}}^2.
  \end{equation*}
  This becomes
  \begin{equation*}
    \left(\vec{x} - \frac43\vec{b} + \frac13\vec{a}\right)
    \cdot
    \left(\vec{x} - \frac43\vec{b} + \frac13\vec{a}\right)
    =
    \frac49(\vec{b}-\vec{a})\cdot(\vec{b}-\vec{a}).
  \end{equation*}
  Expanding and simplifying then reduces this equation to
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{\vec{x}}^2 - \frac83\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}
    + \frac23\vec{a}\cdot\vec{x} + \frac43\abs{\vec{b}}^2
    - \frac13\abs{\vec{a}}^2 = 0.
  \end{equation*}
  Finally, if we square and expand equation \eqref{eq:dist-x-a} in the
  same way, we see that it reduces to the same equation
  above. Therefore \eqref{eq:dist-x-a} holds if and only if
  $\abs{\vec{x}-\vec{c}} = r$.
\end{solution}

\Exercise{20} With reference to the Appendix, suppose that property
(III) were omitted from the definition of a cut. Keep the same
definitions of order and addition. Show that the resulting ordered set
has the least-upper-bound property, that addition satisfies axioms
(A1) to (A4) (with a slightly different zero-element!) but that (A5)
fails.
\begin{solution}
  The proof that the set has the least-upper-bound property is the
  same as the proof given in Step~3 in the Appendix, except that we
  don't need the part which shows that (III) holds.

  Similarly, the proofs for (A1) through (A3) do not require
  modification. However, the proof for (A4) doesn't quite work since
  it makes use of property (III).

  Instead, define
  \begin{equation*}
    0' = \{ r\in Q \mid r \leq 0 \}.
  \end{equation*}
  Then for any cut $\alpha$, if $r\in\alpha$ and $s\in0'$ then
  $r+s\leq r$ so $r+s\in\alpha$. Therefore $\alpha +
  0'\subset\alpha$. Now pick $p\in\alpha$. Then $p + 0\in\alpha + 0'$
  so that $\alpha\subset\alpha + 0'$. This shows (A4).

  Finally, define $0^* = \{r\in Q\mid r < 0\}$. Then $0^*$ is a cut
  since it satisfies properties (I) and (II), however there is no cut
  $\alpha$ such that $0^* + \alpha = 0'$. If there is such an
  $\alpha$, then in particular $0\in0^* + \alpha$ so that for some
  $r\in0^*$, we have $-r\in\alpha$. But $r < 0$ so $r/2\in0^*$. Then
  $r/2 + (-r) \in 0^* + \alpha$ but $r/2 - r > 0$ which shows
  $r/2 - r\not\in0'$. Hence $0^* + \alpha \neq 0'$ so (A5) does not
  hold.
\end{solution}
