\Exercise1 Prove that convergence of $\{s_n\}$ implies convergence of
$\{\abs{s_n}\}$. Is the converse true?
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\{s_n\}$ converges to $s$ for some complex sequence
  $\{s_n\}$ and $s\in C$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Then we
  may find $N$ such that $\abs{s_n - s} < \varepsilon$ for all
  $n\geq N$. Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{\abs{s_n} - \abs{s}} \leq \abs{s_n - s} < \varepsilon
    \quad\text{for each $n\geq N$.}
  \end{equation*}
  Hence $\{\abs{s_n}\}$ converges to $\abs{s}$.

  Note that the converse is {\em not} necessarily true. For example
  the real sequence $\{a_n\}$ given by $a_n = (-1)^n$ does not
  converge even though $\{\abs{a_n}\}$ converges to $1$.
\end{proof}
